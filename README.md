## Description

A sample [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) presentation customized using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). The presentation was created from an Emacs org-mode file using [org-reveal](https://github.com/yjwen/org-reveal).

-   Since not all the customizations were possible using Tailwind utilities, a custom CSS and JS files were created.
-   A <span class="underline">must</span> for adapting this presentation to your needs is to check the [Readme](https://github.com/yjwen/org-reveal/blob/master/Readme.org) file for the org-reveal package.
-   For those not familiar with reveal.js it is recommended to see the demo presentation on the link above to learn more about its capabilities.
-   Also check Tailwind [documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) to learn more about the utilities for customization since not all are covered here.
